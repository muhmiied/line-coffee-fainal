# Line Coffee V3 Project Log

Every AI agent or developer who works on this project must append a new entry to the Agent Work Log before finishing their session.

This file is the project timeline and current operating reference. It should be read together with `AGENT_WORK_PROTOCOL.md` and `CLAUDE.md` before any new AI/dev session.

---

## 1. Project Overview

Line Coffee V3 is the current working foundation for the future Line Coffee ecommerce and operations platform.

The project is no longer only a homepage visual foundation. The public website, customer-facing flows, and Admin Dashboard mock UI are now active.

Current status:

- Public homepage visual direction is largely locked.
- Product catalog and product experience exist or are in active development.
- Customer-facing account area exists or is planned before final backend binding.
- Admin Dashboard mock modules are actively being built and reviewed module by module.
- Supabase/backend integration is deferred until UI/business flows are reviewed.
- All current admin/dashboard work is mock-only unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Core execution direction:

```text
Public Website
→ Customer Account Area
→ Admin Dashboard Mock UI
→ Media Studio Architecture
→ Supabase / Backend Binding
```

Supabase remains the future source of truth, but current work should stay mock-only until backend integration is explicitly approved.

---

## 2. Current Visual Direction

The public website direction is premium dark coffee luxury: deep coffee-black backgrounds, warm beige and gold accents, editorial typography, restrained motion, soft borders, and calm image-led sections.

Do not reintroduce:

- Trust strips
- Smoke bridges
- Gradient bridges
- Section blend systems
- Transitional fog
- Random decorative animation

Keep transitions clean through spacing, background continuity, refined stacked sections, and restrained editorial motion.

Admin/dashboard UI should also stay dark, premium, operational, and Line Coffee branded. It should not look like a generic SaaS template, a white ERP, or a copied dashboard kit.

---

## 3. Current Architecture Direction

General rules:

- Keep public website sections modular and separated.
- Keep shared public layout in `src/components/layout/public`.
- Keep shared UI primitives in `src/components/ui`.
- Keep mock data in `src/lib/mock-data` until future CMS/Supabase binding is explicitly approved.
- Preserve bilingual data as `{ en, ar }` localized values where applicable.
- Respect Arabic/English and RTL/LTR behavior.
- Keep client components focused and avoid broad refactors.
- Do not scan or rewrite the entire repository unless explicitly approved.
- Identify exact files before editing.
- Keep patches minimal and scoped.

Current architecture mindset:

- Public website and customer flows are being shaped first.
- Admin Dashboard is being built as a mock operating system before database binding.
- Media Studio is the future owner of public visual content and page section control.
- Supabase/database will later become the source of truth for products, customers, orders, inventory, content, analytics, and settings.

---

## 4. Current Route Map

### Public Website

- `/` — Homepage
- `/products` — Product listing / catalog entry
- `/products/category/[slug]` — Category page
- `/products/[slug]` — Product detail page
- `/about` — Brand story page
- `/blog` — Blog / Journal
- `/blog/[slug]` — Blog post
- `/contact` — Contact page
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy
- `/terms` — Terms & Conditions
- `/shipping` — Shipping Policy
- `/returns` — Returns Policy

### Custom Builders

- `/make-your-espresso` — Make Your Espresso builder
- `/make-your-flavor` — Make Your Flavor builder

Important builder decision:

- Do **not** split Make Your Espresso into Beginner vs Advanced modes.
- All options should be available together.
- Use a selector/box style with tabs such as Quick Select and Custom Ratios.
- Suggested blend direction cards/chips should include options such as Balanced, Crema Focused, Strong, Smooth Aroma, and Chocolatey.

### Cart / Checkout / Order Flow

- `/cart`
- `/checkout`
- `/order-success`
- `/order-tracking/[id]` — planned/deferred unless explicitly built

### Auth

- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/signup`
- `/auth/forgot-password`
- `/auth/reset-password`

### Customer Account Area

Customer-facing account area should exist before final dashboard/backend binding.

- `/account/profile`
- `/account/orders`
- `/account/orders/[id]`
- `/account/addresses`
- `/account/wishlist`
- `/account/notifications`
- `/account/settings`

Customer profile requirements:

- View previous orders.
- Track current order.
- Edit name, email, phone, address.
- Manage profile picture.
- If no uploaded profile picture, show generated avatar or allow preset avatar selection.
- Customer notifications are required.

### Admin Dashboard

Admin routes live under `/admin/*`.

Current dashboard module list:

- `/admin/dashboard`
- `/admin/orders`
- `/admin/products`
- `/admin/inventory`
- `/admin/customers`
- `/admin/marketing`
- `/admin/accounting`
- `/admin/analytics`
- `/admin/cms`
- `/admin/espresso-manager`
- `/admin/flavor-manager`

Media Studio is separate from the regular Admin Dashboard and should not be treated as just another basic sidebar module unless explicitly approved.

---

## 5. Current Homepage Structure

`LineCoffeeHome` renders these sections in order:

1. `HeroSection`
2. `CategoriesSection`
3. `FeaturesSection`
4. `StorySection`
5. `BestSellersSection`
6. `JournalSection`
7. `TestimonialsSection`
8. `SocialGallerySection`
9. `ContactSection`

The page is wrapped by `PublicHeader` and `PublicFooter` from the root layout.

Homepage visual direction is considered locked. Do not redesign homepage structure unless explicitly requested.

---

## 6. Current Component / Data Map

### Public Website Core

- `src/app/page.tsx` — homepage entry.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — root layout, fonts, language provider, public header/footer.
- `src/app/globals.css` — global tokens, typography, nav styling, hero animation helpers, section system, cards, buttons, marquee behavior, reveal behavior, admin CSS, and responsive rules.
- `src/features/website/home/LineCoffeeHome.tsx` — homepage section composition and scroll reveal hook.
- `src/features/website/home/sections/*` — homepage sections.
- `src/features/website/home/hooks/useLuxuryScrollReveal.ts` — viewport reveal helper.
- `src/components/layout/public/PublicHeader.tsx` — public header, announcement bar, navigation, language, cart/wishlist/user controls.
- `src/components/layout/public/PublicFooter.tsx` — public footer.
- `src/components/ui/SectionHeading.tsx` — shared section heading.
- `src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx` — public product card used by public surfaces.
- `src/lib/context/language.tsx` — English/Arabic language and direction context.
- `src/lib/mock-data/visual-content.ts` — homepage visual content and assets.
- `src/lib/mock-data/product-catalog.ts` — product catalog/pricing source used by product/admin flows.

### Admin Dashboard Core

- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` — admin layout shell entry.
- `src/components/admin/layout/AdminShell.tsx` — fixed admin overlay shell.
- `src/components/admin/layout/AdminSidebar.tsx` — admin sidebar navigation.
- `src/components/admin/layout/AdminTopBar.tsx` — admin top bar/profile/workspace controls.
- `src/lib/mock-data/admin/*` — admin mock data per module.

### Current Admin Module Data Files

- `dashboard-mock.ts`
- `orders-mock.ts`
- `products-admin-mock.ts`
- `inventory-mock.ts`
- `customers-mock.ts`
- `marketing-mock.ts`

## 7. Current Completed / Approved Work

### Public Website / Customer Flows

- Next.js App Router foundation exists.
- Public header and footer exist.
- Homepage visual sections exist and render from mock content.
- Language context supports English and Arabic direction switching.
- Shared visual tokens and section/card/button systems exist in global CSS.
- Hero carousel, stats count-up, category/product/social marquees, and scroll reveal are implemented.
- Product catalog source exists with the real Line Coffee category/product pricing direction.
- Product category and detail pages have been built in mock/UI-only form.
- About page has been built in premium editorial style.
- Auth/login/signup flows have mock local auth behavior.
- Account guard and profile real-user read were added.

### Admin Dashboard Mock UI

Completed/approved mock modules include:

- Admin Shell / Sidebar / Topbar
- Main Dashboard
- Orders
- Products
- Make Your Espresso / Espresso Manager
- Make Your Flavor / Flavor Manager
- Inventory
- Customers
- Marketing & Promotions initial rebuild

Marketing is currently being restructured again based on the latest business workflow.

---

## 8. Current Known Issues / Active Risks

- Documentation is partially stale because the project moved faster than the docs.
- Some older planning/audit files may contain superseded decisions and should not be treated as current source of truth without review.
- Marketing & Promotions module is mid-restructure and may be incomplete if an AI session stopped due to usage limit.
- Backend/Supabase is not connected yet; all admin/dashboard changes are mock-only unless explicitly stated.
- Admin local state changes reset on refresh.
- Announcement bar management in Marketing is mock-only and should not touch the public header until approved.
- Cart and Wishlist drawers were previously noted as only working on homepage and should later be global public overlays via PublicHeader/PublicLayout.
- Sitemap issue was previously deferred: live sitemap may still show only `/lander` instead of the correct route set.

---

## 9. Current Deferred Items

- Supabase/database connection.
- Real authentication and role-based access.
- Real order persistence and transactional checkout.
- Real inventory deduction and purchase order integration.
- Media Studio full architecture and live public section control.
- Marketing automation / real WhatsApp/email sending.
- Payment gateway integration.
- Analytics real tracking.
- PDF invoice / print invoice system.
- Order tracking public page unless explicitly built.
- Full accessibility and keyboard audit.
- Production SEO/sitemap cleanup.
- Final image/media replacement and optimization.

---

## 10. Current Next Steps

Immediate current priority:

1. Finish **Marketing & Promotions restructure**.
2. Visually review Marketing screens.
3. Commit and push checkpoint.
4. Continue module-by-module:
   - Accounting
   - Analytics
   - CMS
5. After admin mock modules are reviewed, prepare backend/Supabase binding plan.

Latest approved Marketing structure:

- Offers
- Promo Codes
- Announcement Bar
- Performance

Removed from Marketing as separate tabs:

- Customer Targeting
- Website Banners broad management
- Hero banner management
- Section banner management

Important Marketing decisions:

- Targeting happens inside Offer/Promo builders.
- Announcement Bar controls only the small rotating bar above the public site header.
- Hero/section/page banners belong later to Media Studio.
- Active offers/codes without announcement messages must show a warning.
- Performance must show original order value, discount given, and paid revenue after discount.
- Usage details should show customers/orders who used each offer/code.
- New offers/codes/messages must be added to local page state immediately, not just show a success flash.

---

## Temporary Arabic Font / Typography Note

Earlier temporary Arabic font comparison work is historical and should not drive new implementation decisions unless explicitly reopened.

Current practical rule:

- Arabic typography must remain premium, readable, and consistent.
- Do not reintroduce temporary section-by-section font experiments.
- Do not add new font files unless explicitly approved.
- Never expose or share font files.

| 2026-06-16 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Homepage Final Polish — Card Animation, Language Flicker, Hero RTL Arrows, Marquee RTL (Tasks A–D + follow-up) | `src/app/globals.css`; `src/features/website/home/hooks/useLuxuryScrollReveal.ts`; `src/lib/context/language.tsx`; `src/app/layout.tsx`; `src/features/website/home/sections/HeroSection.tsx`; `LINE_COFFEE_V3_PROJECT_LOG.md`; `CLAUDE.md` | Task A — Card animation: reduced `.reveal-on-scroll` translateY 30px→14px, transition 780ms→660ms, scale 0.988→0.992; reduced `.reveal-from-right` translateX ±42px→±22px, translateY 18px→10px, scale 0.985→0.99; tightened IntersectionObserver rootMargin -12%→-4%, threshold 0.12→0.06, alreadyVisible check uses full window.innerHeight (was 0.94×). Task B — Language flicker: replaced useEffect+setTimeout(0) in LanguageProvider with useLayoutEffect that sets html.dir/lang/dataset synchronously before paint and defers setLanguageState via setTimeout (lint-safe); removed canPersistLanguageRef; simplified persist to always write; added suppressHydrationWarning to html element in layout.tsx; added inline blocking script in head that reads localStorage and sets html.dir/lang/dataset.language before React loads. Task C — Hero RTL arrows: added dir="ltr" to arrow button container to prevent RTL flex reversal from swapping button physical positions; fixed aria-labels to be direction-aware (RTL left button = Next, RTL right button = Previous). Task D — RTL icon audit: all other directional icons already use dir==="rtl" && rotate-180 pattern correctly; no changes needed | Supabase, Dashboard, Checkout, Cart, Orders, Auth, Database, Products pages, Product detail pages, Category pages, Custom builders, API routes, spacing, colors, typography, shimmer, trust strip, smoke/gradient bridges, section blend, transitional fog, marquee animations, stagger delays | `npm run lint` passed; `npm run build` passed with non-fatal SWC native-binding warnings | Next: Start Products Experience phase — /products page, ProductCard component, category pages |
| 2026-06-16 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | RTL Marquee + Language Flicker Follow-up | `src/app/globals.css`; `src/lib/context/language.tsx`; `LINE_COFFEE_V3_PROJECT_LOG.md` | Marquee fix: added `direction: ltr` to all three marquee tracks (prevents RTL flexbox from reversing DOM item order, which was causing duplicate/original copy to be in wrong positions for the seamless-loop translateX animation); removed the three broken `html[dir="rtl"]` animation-name swaps (they pointed tracks at social-drift which starts at translateX(-50%) — wrong starting position in RTL flex layout, causing items to collide in the center and appear/disappear); added `html[dir="rtl"] .category-marquee-track > *, .best-sellers-marquee-track > *` direction: rtl restore so Arabic card text still aligns correctly. Language flicker fix: replaced setTimeout(setLanguageState) in useLayoutEffect with direct synchronous setLanguageState call + eslint-disable comment — React re-renders before first browser paint so user never sees English text flash | Everything not listed | `npm run lint` passed; `npm run build` passed with non-fatal SWC warnings | Next: Products Experience phase |

| 2026-06-16 | Codex GPT-5 | Saved real product catalog pricing source | `src/lib/mock-data/product-catalog.ts`; `LINE_COFFEE_V3_PROJECT_LOG.md` | Added a standalone TypeScript catalog source with 9 categories and 152 products from the supplied price sheets; stored customer sale prices, 250g/500g size prices where supplied, per-kg prices, internal purchase costs, and cleaner Arabic product/category names for future product-page work | Homepage UI, `/products` UI, Supabase, Dashboard, Cart, Checkout, Orders, Auth, DB/migrations, and existing mock files | `npm run lint` passed; `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; Node import check confirmed 9 categories, 152 products, purchase costs saved for every product, and no Arabic mojibake in the new file | Next: wait for the user's product-page prompt and build from this saved catalog source |
| 2026-06-17 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | /about page — Brand Story Editorial | `src/app/(public)/about/page.tsx` (new); `LINE_COFFEE_V3_PROJECT_LOG.md` | Built premium bilingual About page at `/about`. 5 sections: (1) Editorial Intro — `.products-hero`, two-column `flex-row` with portrait roastery image and story copy; Since 2015 badge, serif h1, warm body, CTA → /products. (2) Philosophy (reversed columns) — `.cinematic-section`, `.luxury-panel` text panel with roasting philosophy + 3 pillars, dark-roast.png image. (3) Journey Timeline — centered single-column editorial with dot+line track, 3 milestones (2015 / 2018 / Today). (4) Quote Band — `.cinematic-section`, full-bleed roastery image at low opacity, cinematic dark overlay, large serif quote. (5) Final CTA — 3 buttons: Explore Products (`.premium-button`), Make Your Espresso (`.studio-espresso-btn`), Make Your Flavor (`.studio-flavor-btn`). Column order in sections 1+2 controlled explicitly via `lg:order-1`/`lg:order-2` (direction-sensitive in flex — order-1 is at main-axis start, which is left in LTR and right in RTL). No globals.css changes. All copy inline mock `{en, ar}` objects via `t()`. No direct `.en/.ar` rendering. | Homepage, product pages, builders, Supabase, Dashboard, Cart, Checkout | `npm run lint` → 0 errors; `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors; `npm run build` → ✓ 8 routes |
| 2026-06-17 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Product Experience Final Code Cleanup | `src/app/(public)/products/category/[slug]/page.tsx`; `LINE_COFFEE_V3_PROJECT_LOG.md` | Simplified redundant ternary in `sortProducts`: `const locale = language === "ar" ? "ar" : "en"` → `const locale = language` (`language` is already typed `"en" \| "ar"`, so the conditional was an identity). No behavioral change. All other cleanup items across the 4 scoped files (products/page, products/[slug]/page, CatalogProductCard) were confirmed clean — no dead imports, no localization violations, no broken links. | Everything not listed | `npm run lint` → 0 errors 0 warnings; `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors; `npm run build` → ✓ |
| 2026-06-18 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Phase B+C+D — Blog, Legal, Shopping Flow (18 routes total) | `src/lib/mock-data/blog-data.ts` (new); `src/app/(public)/blog/page.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (new); `src/components/ui/LegalPageLayout.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/privacy/page.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/terms/page.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/shipping/page.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/returns/page.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/cart/page.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/checkout/page.tsx` (new); `src/app/(public)/order-success/page.tsx` (new); `src/components/layout/public/PublicFooter.tsx` (modified); `src/components/layout/public/PublicHeader.tsx` (modified); `LINE_COFFEE_V3_PROJECT_LOG.md`; `CLAUDE.md` | Phase B — Blog: `blog-data.ts` defines `BlogPost` type (slug, title, excerpt, image, category, date, readTime, featured, tags, body blocks) with 6 bilingual posts (origins-of-arabic-coffee featured, roast-notes, blend-guide, freshness, turkish-ritual, espresso-craft). `/blog` page: hero (products-hero), featured article full-width card, search input (client filter), category pill filter, posts grid 3-col lg. `/blog/[slug]` page: cover hero, breadcrumb, meta row, serial h1, structured body blocks (heading/paragraph, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML), related articles 2-col, products CTA strip. Phase C — Legal: `LegalPageLayout.tsx` shared component (hero + last-updated + sections + contact CTA). `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/shipping`, `/returns` each render the layout with realistic bilingual Egyptian e-commerce content. Footer fixed: removed `/reviews` dead link, fixed `/privacy-policy`→`/privacy` and `/terms-of-use`→`/terms`, added `/shipping` and `/returns` to support column. Phase D — Shopping Flow: `/cart` reads `useCart()` context, two-column (items + sticky summary), delivery fee calc (free ≥500 EGP else 50 EGP), link to `/checkout`. `/checkout`: customer info + address + delivery method selector + order summary sidebar; validates required fields; on submit saves items snapshot to sessionStorage, calls clearCart(), navigates to `/order-success?order=LC-XXXXXX`. `/order-success`: Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams, reads snapshot from sessionStorage, clears cart on mount, shows order number + items or generic fallback, two CTAs (Continue shopping / Back to home). Header: "Proceed to checkout" button → Link to `/checkout`; "View full cart" text link added to cart popover. | Homepage, About, Contact, Products, Make Your Espresso, Make Your Flavor, product-catalog.ts, Supabase, Dashboard, Auth, real payment, order backend | `npm run lint` → 0 errors 0 warnings; `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors; `npm run build` → ✓ 18 routes |
